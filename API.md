# Activity API

Other extensions can ask this one what the session is doing — and what it has
done — without scraping the transcript or hooking the renderer.

```ts
const api = (globalThis as any)[Symbol.for("pi-tool-tree:api")];
if (api?.getActivity) {
	const { phase, label, run } = api.getActivity();
	// "tool", "implementing", { toolCalls: 3, elapsedMs: 41_200, … }
}
```

The object is published on `globalThis` under two keys, both pointing at the
**same instance** (so state and subscriptions are shared):

| Key | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `Symbol.for("pi-tool-tree:api")` | Preferred. |
| `Symbol.for("pi-tool-tree:activity-api")` | The key the activity-label hook shipped with; kept for plugins written against it. |

## Quick start

A status line that shows the current activity, updated whenever it changes:

```ts
const api = (globalThis as any)[Symbol.for("pi-tool-tree:api")];
if (api?.subscribe) {
	api.subscribe((activity: any, change: any) => {
		if (change.type === "tool-end") {
			console.log(`${change.toolName} ${change.isError ? "failed" : "finished"} in ${api.formatDuration(change.durationMs)}`);
			return;
		}
		if (activity.isWorking) {
			console.log(`${activity.label}: ${activity.phase} (${api.formatDuration(activity.run.elapsedMs)})`);
		} else {
			console.log(`idle · ${api.formatDuration(api.getStats().workedMs)} of work this session`);
		}
	});
}
```

Getters are cheap and always current, so a component that repaints on its own
schedule can simply call `getActivity()` in its render instead of subscribing:
durations are measured at the moment you ask.

## `getActivity()`

Returns a snapshot of what is happening **right now**.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phase` | `"idle" \| "waiting" \| "thinking" \| "responding" \| "tool"` | What the agent is doing. See [phases](#phases). |
| `isWorking` | `boolean` | An agent run is in flight (`phase !== "idle"`). |
| `isThinking` | `boolean` | Reasoning is streaming right now. |
| `isRunningTool` | `boolean` | At least one tool call is executing right now. |
| `label` | `string \| null` | Model-declared activity label for the current phase (e.g. `"implementing"`). `null` only while idle. |
| `labelStartedAt` | `number \| null` | Epoch ms when the current label took effect. |
| `labelElapsedMs` | `number` | Wall time spent on the current label, measured to this call. |
| `labelCalls` | `number` | Tool calls started under the current label. |
| `thinkingStartedAt` | `number \| null` | Start of the reasoning block that is streaming, if any. |
| `thinkingElapsedMs` | `number` | Length of that block so far; `0` when nothing is streaming. |
| `calls` | `ActivityRunningCall[]` | Calls executing right now, in start order. |
| `run` | `ActivityRunStats` | Counters for the current run (all zero while idle). |

Each entry of `calls` has `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `label`, `startedAt`, and
`elapsedMs` (live).

`run` carries `startedAt`, `elapsedMs`, `turns`, `toolCalls`,
`toolCallsRunning`, `toolCallsFailed`, `toolMs`, and `thinkingMs`.

### Phases

| Phase | When |
| --- | --- |
| `idle` | No run in flight. `run` is zeroed and `label` is `null`. |
| `waiting` | A run is in flight but nothing is streaming: waiting for the model's first token, or between a tool result and the next response. |
| `thinking` | Reasoning is streaming. |
| `responding` | The model is streaming output — answer text or tool-call arguments. |
| `tool` | At least one tool call is executing. Takes precedence over `thinking`/`responding`. |

```ts
const a = api.getActivity();
if (a.isRunningTool) {
	for (const call of a.calls) console.log(`${call.toolName} running ${api.formatDuration(call.elapsedMs)}`);
} else if (a.isThinking) {
	console.log(`thinking for ${api.formatDuration(a.thinkingElapsedMs)}`);
}
```

## `getStats()`

Returns cumulative statistics for the session, including history restored on
resume/reload/fork.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workedMs` | `number` | Completed agent work: the sum of finished runs, idle time excluded. The same number the transcript's `Total time` reports. |
| `runs` | `number` | Finished runs. |
| `turns` | `number` | pi turns across those runs (one model response plus the calls it made). |
| `toolCalls` | `number` | Tool calls that finished. |
| `toolCallsFailed` | `number` | Of those, the ones that ended with an error. |
| `toolMs` | `number` | Summed call time. |
| `thinkingMs` | `number` | Summed reasoning time. |
| `thinkingBlocks` | `number` | Reasoning blocks that finished. |
| `byTool` | `Record<string, { calls, failed, durationMs }>` | Per tool name. |
| `byLabel` | `Record<string, { calls, durationMs }>` | Per activity label. |

## `subscribe(listener)`

```ts
const unsubscribe = api.subscribe((activity, change) => { /* … */ });
unsubscribe();
```

The listener receives the snapshot **after** the change plus a description of
what changed. Listeners run synchronously as pi's events arrive; anything a
listener throws is swallowed so a broken consumer cannot take the agent down.

| `change.type` | Extra fields | Fired |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run-start` | — | A run begins (`before_agent_start` / `agent_start`). Fires once per run: a second start event while the agent is busy (steering, queued prompt) does not reset it. |
| `turn-start` | — | A turn begins. |
| `label-change` | `label` | The model named a new phase. |
| `thinking-start` | — | Reasoning began streaming. |
| `thinking-end` | `durationMs` | Reasoning stopped (a missing `thinking_end` is closed by the next stream output or by the end of the message). |
| `stream-start` | — | The model started streaming output. |
| `stream-end` | — | It stopped. |
| `tool-start` | `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `label` | A call started executing. |
| `tool-end` | `toolCallId`, `toolName`, `isError`, `durationMs` | A call finished. |
| `run-end` | `durationMs`, `run` | A run finished. The snapshot is already idle, so the finished run's totals are in `change.run`. |

Because the snapshot handed to a `run-end` listener is idle, read
`change.run` for that run's numbers:

```ts
api.subscribe((activity, change) => {
	if (change.type !== "run-end") return;
	console.log(`run finished: ${api.formatDuration(change.run.elapsedMs)}, ${change.run.toolCalls} calls, ${change.run.turns} turns`);
});
```

## `formatDuration(ms)`

The transcript's own duration formatting, so extension output can match it:
`"<1s"`, `"12s"`, `"3m 05s"`, `"1h 02m"`.

## `wrapTool(tool)`

Adds the `activity` parameter to a tool definition another extension registers,
defaults a missing label, and strips it again before `execute` runs.

```ts
const api = (globalThis as any)[Symbol.for("pi-tool-tree:api")];
pi.registerTool(api?.wrapTool ? api.wrapTool(buildMyTool()) : buildMyTool());
```

`pi.getAllTools()` exposes no `execute`, so tools this package does not own
cannot be wrapped from the outside — a plugin has to wrap its own definition
before registering it. `wrapTool` is a no-op when the `toolActivityParam`
setting is off, so it can be called unconditionally.

The other fields on the object describe that integration: `param` (`"activity"`),
`defaultLabel` (`"working"`), and `enabled()`.

## What the numbers mean

- **A run** is one prompt-to-answer cycle: `before_agent_start`/`agent_start`
  until `agent_end`. It is the same window the transcript treats as its live
  chunk, so a run's `elapsedMs` matches the header's timer while it runs.
- **A turn** is pi's unit: one model response plus the tool calls it makes.
- **A call** counts when it *starts* (in the snapshot) and settles when it
  *ends* (in session totals). A call that is still in flight when the run ends
  never produced a result, so it is settled as a failure rather than dropped.
- **`toolMs`** sums call spans. Calls run in parallel, so the sum can exceed the
  wall clock — it is time spent by calls, not time elapsed.
- **Live vs settled**: durations in `getActivity()` include the block or call
  that is running right now, measured to the moment you ask. Session counters in
  `getStats()` only move when something finishes, so a call in flight shows up
  in the snapshot and not in the totals.
- **Labels** come from the `activity` argument the model sends with a call.
  A call that carries no label inherits the label in effect (so MCP and plugin
  calls continue the current phase), and a phase the model has not named yet
  reports `defaultLabel` (`"working"`). `labelElapsedMs` restarts whenever the
  model names a new phase.
- **Idle gaps are excluded** from `workedMs`: time spent reading or typing a
  prompt is not agent work.

## What drives the state

The tracker listens to pi's own events, not to the renderer, so it is correct in
hosts that never paint the grouped rows (RPC, headless, tests) and does not
depend on a component being on screen.

| pi event | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `before_agent_start`, `agent_start` | Start a run (`run-start`). |
| `turn_start` | Count a turn (`turn-start`). |
| `message_start` / `message_end` (assistant) | Close any reasoning/streaming phase left open by the previous message. |
| `message_update` (`thinking_start`/`thinking_delta`/`thinking_end`) | Open/close the reasoning block. |
| `message_update` (`text_*`, `toolcall_*`) | Close an unterminated reasoning block and open/close the output stream. |
| `tool_execution_start` | Count a call, resolve the label, add it to `calls` (`tool-start`). |
| `tool_execution_end` | Settle the call, accumulate per-tool/per-label/session stats (`tool-end`). |
| `agent_end` | Close the run, accumulate run totals (`run-end`). |
| `session_start` | Reset run state and rebuild session counters from the active branch. |
| `session_shutdown` | Reset run state and drop subscriptions. |

## Guarantees and caveats

- **Snapshots are copies.** Mutating what you get back never affects tracked
  state, and each call returns a fresh object.
- **Feature-detect, don't version-check.** `version` stays `1` — it describes the
  `wrapTool` integration contract, which has not changed. The query methods are
  additive, so test for them:

  ```ts
  const api = (globalThis as any)[Symbol.for("pi-tool-tree:api")];
  if (typeof api?.getActivity !== "function") return; // extension not installed / older build
  ```

- **Subscriptions do not survive a reload.** `session_shutdown` drops them, and
  pi reloading extensions replaces the object, so register subscriptions from
  your extension's own init.
- **History has counts, not clocks.** Call counts, failures, runs, turns,
  reasoning time, and per-tool/per-label call counts are rebuilt from the
  session branch on resume. Call *durations* recorded before this process
  started are not recoverable, so `byTool.*.durationMs`, `byLabel.*.durationMs`,
  and `toolMs` only cover calls made since the process started.
- **Timings use `Date.now()`**, and are wall clock, not CPU time.
- **The API is read-only.** There is no way to drive the agent through it.
